# Reference

This directory contains reference implementations and example code.

## Code Examples

### [code/](code/)
Reference TypeScript code examples demonstrating implementation patterns.

**Note:** These are examples and prototypes, not the canonical specification. When in doubt, refer to:
1. [../schema/types.ts](../schema/types.ts) - Canonical type definitions
2. [../implementation/](../implementation/) - Runtime behavior specification

### Contents

- **rules.core.ts** - Example rule module implementation
- **engine.ts** - Reference engine implementation patterns
- **README.md** - Notes on the reference code

## Usage

These files are provided as:
- Implementation guidance
- Design exploration artifacts
- Starting points for engine developers

**Important:** The binding contract is in `/schema` and `/implementation`. Use reference code as inspiration, not gospel.
